**Quick Tip:**
When suggesting a title ask yourself the following:
How would the match look like when someone is fighting you for that title?
- *If you do not have a clear idea of what the match would be, then don't suggest the title. Titles should be simple, and are meant only for the true masters of their concepts.*

**Note:**
You will get a ping if your title suggestion is approved. If you have not received a ping then your title suggestion has either been denied or not reviewed yet.

**Name battle rules:**
1. Map chosen by current title holder.
- *Must relate what the title suggests (e.g. name battle for "Nuke Rusher": rush nukes).*
2. Support weapons are allowed (Machine Gun, Minigun, Sniper, AP Sniper, Magnabeam - only requires an upgrade center, with the exception of Magnabeams (Factory)).
- *All weapons unlocked 4-6 minutes in (judge will announce during match).*
3. Matches are Best of 3.
4. Winner takes the title, the loser has to change name to different title or default name.
