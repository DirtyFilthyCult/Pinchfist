**Overview:**
In the #:trophy:hall-of-names:trophy: every DFC member is listed with the title(s) they own.
To request a title please use !requestTitle <title>
Before requesting a title, make sure it is not claimed yet, using !findTitle <keyword>
You can have a maximum of 2 titles!

**Format and rules:**
1. The nickname must be related to a forts concept.
- *The concept must be distinct and unique. If a concept using ‘nuke’ is created then one cannot create a variation based on that same concept except in the case when that variation changes the original concept significantly (e.g. Warthog Nuke Rusher). This is left to the determination of the mods/admins.* 
- *Concepts based on specific maps or mod names must contain over 20k steam subscriptions. These do not conflict with general concepts in regards to ‘map maker’ or ‘mod maker’ although there is an inherent risk of those titles being harder to retain.*
2. The nickname must be 2 words long, excluding the first two words “Dirty Filthy” except for when specified by a commander.
- *Warthog Nuke Rusher is accepted because the commander allows for three words. Note that this specific example doesn’t conflict with either the Warthog or Nuke titles because Warthog Nukes combined drastically changes the concept of both nukes/warthog.*
3. Anyone must be able to claim the title, and fight for it. 
- *The fights must relate to the title in some way, and also be related to forts.*
- *The fights must be able to be determined by a 1v1 match.*
- *You may hold two titles at once. However your second title cannot be created, you can only gain it through claiming someone else's title.*
